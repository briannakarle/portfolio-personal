    <p>In my time as a student and freelance web designer, I have found that although I love just about every aspect of the field, I enjoy the puzzle that is UX, the most.  I have experience with small card sorts, affinity diagrams, and information architecture.  When in groups, I pounce on the opportunity to work on these parts of the design process.  At home, my walls are covered with diagrams and sticky notes, in spots where normal people would have artwork, shelving, or sconces.  My passion for usability could border on obsession.</p> 
 
<p>I have a background in anthropology and political science.  I like the idea of technology as a vehicle for social change.  As technology advances and becomes increasingly ingrained in society, it can either bring communities together, or tear them apart.  It needs to remain accessible and user-friendly so that it can easily empower and mobilize groups that may not otherwise have the opportunity.
